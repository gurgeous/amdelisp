## Welcome to amd elisp

These are my emacs dotfiles. I first start collecting these back at school, and I've been updating them with help from many people since then.

### To install:

1. Clone the repo into ~/amdelisp or similar.
1. Put the following in your ~/.emacs:

```lisp
(load "/home/me/amdelisp/start")
```
