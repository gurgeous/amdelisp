The number of lines at the top of the file to look in, to find
the command that csharp-mode will use to compile the current
buffer, or the command \"stub\" that csharp-mode will use to
check the syntax of the current buffer via flymake.

If the value of this variable is zero, then csharp-mode looks
everywhere in the file.  If the value is positive, then only in
the first N lines. If negative, then only in the final N lines.

The line should appear in a comment inside the C# buffer.


Compile
--------

In the case of compile, the compile command must be prefixed with
\"compile:\".  For example,

 // compile: csc.exe /r:Hallo.dll Arfie.cs


This command will be suggested as the compile command when the
user invokes `compile' for the first time.


Flymake
--------

In the case of flymake, the command \"stub\" string must be
prefixed with \"flymake:\".  For example,

 // flymake: DOTNETDIRcsc.exe /target:netmodule /r:foo.dll @@FILE@@

In the case of flymake, the string should NOT include the name of
the file for the buffer being checked. Instead, use the token
@@FILE@@ .  csharp-mode will replace this token with the name of
the source file to compile, before passing the command to flymake
to run it.

If for some reason the command is invalid or illegal, flymake
will report an error and disable itself.

It might be handy to run fxcop, for example, via flymake.

 // flymake: fxcopcmd.exe /c  /f:MyLibrary.dll



In all cases
------------

Be sure to specify the proper path for your csc.exe, whatever
version that might be, or no path if you want to use the system
PATH search.

If the buffer depends on external libraries, then you will want
to include /R arguments to that csc.exe command.

To be clear, this variable sets the number of lines to search for
the command.  This cariable is an integer.

If the marker string (either \"compile:\" or \"flymake:\"
is present in the given set of lines, csharp-mode will take
anything after the marker string as the command to run.

(autoload 'csharp-mode "csharp-mode-0.8.5" "\
Major mode for editing C# code. This mode is derived from CC Mode to
support C#.

Normally, you'd want to autoload this mode by setting `auto-mode-alist' with
an entry for csharp, in your .emacs file:

   (autoload 'csharp-mode \"csharp-mode\" \"Major mode for editing C# code.\" t)
   (setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '((\"\\.cs$\" . csharp-mode)) auto-mode-alist))

The mode provides fontification and indent for C# syntax, as well
as some other handy features.

At mode startup, there are two interesting hooks that run:
`c-mode-common-hook' is run with no args, then `csharp-mode-hook' is run after
that, also with no args.

To run your own logic after csharp-mode starts, do this:

  (defun my-csharp-mode-fn ()
    \"my function that runs when csharp-mode is initialized for a buffer.\"
    (turn-on-font-lock)
    (turn-on-auto-revert-mode) ;; helpful when also using Visual Studio
    (setq indent-tabs-mode nil) ;; tabs are evil
    (flymake-mode 1)
    (yas/minor-mode-on)
    (require 'rfringe)  ;; handy for flymake
    (require 'flymake-cursor) ;; also handy for flymake
    ....your own code here...
  )
  (add-hook  'csharp-mode-hook 'my-csharp-mode-fn t)


The function above is just a suggestion.


Compile integration:
========================

csharp-mode binds the function `csharp-invoke-compile-interactively' to
\"\" .  This function attempts to intellgently guess the format of the
compile command to use for a buffer.  It looks in the comments at the head of
the buffer for a line that begins with compile: .  For exammple:

  // compile: csc.exe /t:library /r:Mylib.dll Foo.cs

If csharp-mode finds a line like this, it will suggest the text that follows
as the compilation command when running `compile' for the first time.  If such
a line is not found, csharp-mode falls back to a msbuild or nmake command.
See the documentation on `csharp-cmd-line-limit' for further information. If
you don't want this magic, then you can just run `compile' directly, rather
than `csharp-invoke-compile-interactively' .

This mode will also automatically add a symbol and regexp to the
`compilation-error-regexp-alist' and`compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist'
respectively, for Csc.exe error and warning messages. If you invoke `compile',
then `next-error' should work properly for error messages produced by csc.exe.


Flymake Integraiton
========================

You can use flymake with csharp mode to automatically check the syntax of your
csharp code, and highlight errors.  To do so, add a comment line like this to
each .cs file that you use flymake with:

   //  flymake: csc.exe /t:module /R:Foo.dll @@FILE@@

csharp-mode replaces special tokens in the command with different values:

  @@ORIG@@ - gets replaced with the original filename
  @@FILE@@ - gets replaced with the name of the temporary file
      created by flymake. This is usually what you want in place of the
      name of the file to be compiled.

See the documentation on `csharp-cmd-line-limit' for further information.

You may also want to run a syntax checker, like fxcop:

   //  flymake: fxcopcmd.exe /c /F:MyLibrary.dll

In this case you don't need either of the tokens described above.

If the module has no external dependencies, then you need not specify any
flymake command at all. csharp-mode will implicitly act as if you had
specified the command:

     // flymake: csc.exe /t:module /nologo @@FILE@@

It looks for the EXE on the path.  You can specify a full path if you like.


YASnippet and IMenu Integraiton
===============================

Check the menubar for menu entries for YASnippet and Imenu; the latter
is labelled \"Index\".

The Imenu index gets computed when the file is .cs first opened and loaded.
This may take a moment or two.  If you don't like this delay and don't
use imenu, you can turn this off with the variable `csharp-want-imenu'.
